## 1.1.1
- Remove plugins from project as it seems that rebar3 will also pull in plugins when using owoify_erl as a dependency.
- Fix some typespecs.

## 1.1.0
**This version changed some mappings in presets, so the same input probably won't return the same result as version 1.0.0.**

- Add more word mappings so it's on par with mohan-cao's latest owoify.
- Clean up some type specs.
- Add uwuify and uvuify for convenience.
- Apply rebar3_format to clean up the code.
